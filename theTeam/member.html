							<h3>President. Michelle Yoon</h3>
							<span>Hello! I'm Michelle Yoon, a senior at Amador Valley High School. I am proud to serve you as LiNK Club's President for 2017-2018! I'm an upbeat and enthusiastic gal who loves vintage coffee shops and striped shirts. In my free time, you would most likely find me playing viola or putting up motivational sticky notes that I completely ignore throughout the school year. I definitely look forward to serving you through LiNK Club, and I cannot wait to see what the future holds. üçé</span>

A side fact is that she spends the majority of her money on makeup so she is always broke. Hah. She hopes to promote LiNK as much as she could and free those who are trapped in North Korea.</span>

							<h3>Info & Tech Manager. Mayank Sharma</h3>
							<span> Greetings, peasants. I'm a senior and one of LiNK's Technology Officers. As part of my massive superiority over the vast majority of the population, I have memorized 63 digits of pi, beaten Battletoads (without save states), and taught several 5-year-olds to quote Nietzsche. I am also 10% of Taco Bell's consumer base, a communist, and a connoisseur of Netflix. I enjoy math. Still feelin' the Bern. </span>
